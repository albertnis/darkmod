# DarkMOD
*A dynamic MusicBee skin using PHP*

[![Project link][screenshot]][project]

I love MusicBee, but at times, its theming engine is not particularly user-friendly. The title bar colour, for example, is actually defined as a tiled PNG image. This makes it hard for the user to quickly change the colour of a theme. When I set out to make DarkMOD, I was aiming for a "splash of colour" type theme, where against a neutral dark base the user could select an accent to taste. When I realised this would be difficult, I decided to turn the project into a website which generates a complete theme based on a template and a colour input from the user.
